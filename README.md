Welcome to Andrew Walters' Phase 1 Final Project for Flatiron School!

This application is a search working with TV Maze's API to allow the user to search for a TV show, see its poster and title and then add it to a "Watch List."

Simply search for the desired keyword in the search bar and up to 10 results will be appended to the "Search Results" field. Any show the user desires to add to their watch list can be added by clicking the "Add to Watch List" button. Items in the watch list can then be seen by clicking the "Open Watch List" button just below the search input. The watch list can be hidden again by clicking the "Close Watch List" button. Any item can be removed from the watch list by clicking the "remove" button. It's simple!
